\begin{enumerate}
\item Implement at least two different Power(x,n)  methods as described in the course. Compare their running times experimentally and analytically.
\item Implement at least two different Fibonacci methods as described in the course. Compare their running times experimentally and analytically. How can we write an efficient recursive Fibonacci method?
